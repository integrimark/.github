## IntegriMark

IntegriMark is more than just an open-source tool; it's a movement towards a more responsible and equitable academic environment. It seeks to address the challenge of equitable access to educational resources while protecting the integrity of academic assessments. Designed with both educators and students in mind, it offers a user-friendly, automated solution for sharing educational materials securely. Our tool not only protects the integrity of course materials but also empowers educators to enhance their teaching methods. IntegriMark fosters a sense of community and responsibility, encouraging norms that value the protection of educational resources. By choosing IntegriMark, you're not just choosing a secure document-sharing platform; you're supporting a culture of transparency, equity, and academic integrity. Join us in shaping the future of education with IntegriMark!
